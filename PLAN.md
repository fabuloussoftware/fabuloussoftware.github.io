I want to create a website for my company, Fabulous Software, Inc.  My business is as a solo contract programmer and I want to create a website about me and my work. I plan to publish the site somewhere for free and to have a blog.  The site structure would pretty much be just a homepage and the blog for now.

- I want to start out by creating a site using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.  I have a github account, but I've never used github pages, so I would need to know how ot set this up.
- Brand assets can be found in the assets/brand folder, and I would like to base color choices of of those assets.
- My github account is at https://github.com/jamesehly
- I added a resume to the assets folder so that you can see my experience.
